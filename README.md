**Overview**

This Rust application, built using the Yew framework for web Assembly, displays a collection of champion skins from a popular game, organizing them based on their ownership status and allowing users to sort the displayed items. 

* Green means Owned
* Blue means not owned but skin shard available
* Gray means not owned

**Motivations**

This was developed as prototype to practice Rust and learn a web assembly framework. I kind of got bored mainly cause of CSS and front ending. I also stopped playing league so..
